Hi, Xingyue here.

This folder contains the results for mixing the MSA information corresponding to closed and open states of AdK to pave the conformational changing pathway in between.

Files contain:

1. Closed MSA Hints with low d_E_{HF} values (size 500) vs. Open MSA Hints with high d_E_{HF} values (size 50) --> Mixing50, w: 0.01~0.4; (since size 500 is a large values, w=0.4 is already big enough to see fully closed structures.)

2. Closed MSA Hints with low d_E_{HF} values (size 500) vs. Open MSA Hints with high d_E_{HF} values (size 100) --> Mixing100, w: 0.01~0.09; (since size 500 is a large values, plus adding the MSA set size would bias the closed state, w=0.09 is already big enough to see fully closed structures.)
