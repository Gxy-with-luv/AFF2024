Read Me

Hi there, this is Xingyue. This folder contains the scripts for treading energy calculation using Rosetta.

If I include all the result .pdb and .log files, the file size for each protein would exceed many giga bytes. These results can be produced running the given scripts.

But if you want the results without running the scripts, contact me via xingyue@smail.nju.edu.cn.

Good luck!
